<p> Although I did not participate in Intrams, I learned about the value of sportsmanship and staying active.
 Watching my classmates compete made me realize how important teamwork and discipline are, both in sports and in life. 
 I would explain to others that Intrams is a time to encourage physical fitness and cooperation. Having this event motivates students to stay healthy and work well with others.</p>

<p> In AP Month, I participated in the quiz held inside the classroom. This helped me review and strengthen my knowledge of Araling Panlipunan topics.
 I realized that learning about history and government is important because it helps us understand real-life situations and current events better. 
If I were to teach a friend, I would tell them that AP Month makes learning fun and interactive through quizzes and projects.
 Events like this help us remember important lessons and apply them outside school. </p>

<p> During Science Month, I participated in the research defense with my group. 
This experience taught me how to prepare, present, and defend our research, which improved my confidence and scientific understanding.
